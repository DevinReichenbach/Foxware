Hello! This project is intended for the M5StickPlusC2. I wanted to create my own firmware that had a fun environment to it as well as useful tools.

I also wanted to develop my C++ and embedded skills.


I am using the PlatformIO extension through VSCode for developemnt, my .ini file is included in the repo for build purposes.
